      My name is Dalton Wood. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree at Western Governors
      University. I am actively seeking internships, volunteer work, and opportunities to provide
      real-world value with these new skills. You can reach out with questions or feedback via the

      I'm a veteran. After years of incredibly rewarding military service, I decided to move on to
      face new challenges. I completed a technical certification program, and launched my career in
      IT. As I gained experience, two things stood out to me: First, the IT field is vast in every
      dimension - there is no shortage of deep and interesting subfields to dive into. Second, there
      are two clearly different user experiences with technology. As 'Tech Support' or an
      administrator, there is only so much you can do to improve the user experience. If the
      software or website is poorly developed, user training, and workarounds only get you so far.
      This insight inspired me to learn how to develop solutions myself.
