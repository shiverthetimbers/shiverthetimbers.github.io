      My name is Dalton Wood. I am a student currently pursuing a bachelor's degree at Western
      Governors University. I'm a veteran, but as challenging and rewarding as my military career
      was, it was a far cry from anything IT related. After years of honorable service, I moved on
      to face new challenges as a civilian. I completed a technical certification program, and was
      able to launch my career in IT. I have realized over the last few years just how broad and
      dynamic the field of Information Technology is, and it's been a battle finding my place.

      In 2024, I decided to pursue a degree in Software Engineering with no prior experience. Again,
      I learned just how broad even a subfield of IT can be - a myriad of languages, development
      methodologies, complex structures and algorithms, and design philosophies. At this point in my
      journey, I am just scratching the surface of so many different areas. I enjoy the aesthetic
      and organizational aspects of front-end development, but I continue to challenge myself across
      all aspects of software. Below, you will find a few projects that I hope will show you how
      much I've learned in a short time.

      As a junior at WGU, I am actively seeking internships, volunteer work, and other opportunities
      to provide real-world value with these new skills. If you would like to connect or provide
      feedback of any kind, please check out my projects and fill out the
      <a href="#contactApp">contact</a> form at the bottom of the page.
